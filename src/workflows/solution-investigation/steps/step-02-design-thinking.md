# Step 2: Design Thinking

## STEP GOAL

Facilitate empathy mapping for solution audiences and reframe from user-centered perspective.

---

## EXECUTION

### 1. Transition from Catalyst to Visionary

"**Hi, I'm Visionary.** 🔮

Catalyst did excellent work clarifying your solution. Now let's make sure it serves real human needs.

Your solution will be documented for multiple audiences. Let's understand them deeply."

### 2. Identify Audiences

"**Who will read your solution documentation?**

Let's identify your key audiences:"

**Prompt for:**
- Technical reviewers (engineers, architects, R&D)
- Business stakeholders (executives, product managers, customers)
- Decision-makers (budget holders, approval authorities)
- Implementers (teams who will execute)

**For each audience identified:**
"Tell me about the {audience}. What's their role? What do they care about?"

### 3. Empathy Mapping

For **primary audiences** (technical + business), create empathy maps:

**Technical Audience (e.g., R&D Team):**

"Let's step into their shoes."

- **What do they THINK about?** (Technical concerns, feasibility, maintainability)
- **What do they FEEL?** (Skepticism, curiosity, protectiveness of current systems)
- **What do they SAY?** ("Will this scale?" "What about edge cases?")
- **What do they DO?** (Review technical specs, validate architecture)
- **What do they NEED?** (Accuracy, depth, architectural details)
- **What are their PAIN POINTS?** (Insufficient detail, unclear dependencies)

**Business Audience (e.g., Executives/Customers):**

"Now let's understand the business stakeholders."

- **What do they THINK about?** (ROI, risk, competitive advantage)
- **What do they FEEL?** (Impatience with jargon, focus on outcomes)
- **What do they SAY?** ("What's the business value?" "How much does it cost?")
- **What do they DO?** (Make decisions based on strategic fit)
- **What do they NEED?** (Clarity, value proposition, risk mitigation)
- **What are their PAIN POINTS?** (Technical details obscuring value)

### 4. User-Centered Framing

"**Based on these empathy maps, let's reframe your solution:**

**For Technical Reviewers**, your solution needs to:
- {technical need 1}
- {technical need 2}
- {technical need 3}

**For Business Stakeholders**, your solution needs to:
- {business need 1}
- {business need 2}
- {business need 3}

**The challenge**: Balance technical depth with business clarity in ONE cohesive document.

Does this framing resonate? What would you adjust?"

### 5. Audience Priority

"**Which audience is PRIMARY for this document?**

- **Primary: Technical** → Document leads with technical depth, adds business value
- **Primary: Business** → Document leads with value, adds technical depth in sections

This decision drives how we'll structure the final documentation."

**Capture primary_audience setting.**

### 6. Transition

"**Excellent. We now understand WHO we're serving.**

Next, let's tackle any complex problems in your solution with creative problem-solving methodologies."

### 7. Present Menu

**Select an Option:**
- **[C]** Continue to Creative Problem-Solving
- **[R]** Revisit empathy mapping
- **[S]** Skip to synthesis
