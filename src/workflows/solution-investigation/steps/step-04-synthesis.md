# Step 4: Refinement & Synthesis

## STEP GOAL

Synthesize all insights from investigation and produce refined solution understanding document.

---

## EXECUTION

### 1. Transition to Weaver

"**Hi, I'm Weaver.** 🧵

The Innovation Support team did excellent work exploring your solution. Let me synthesize everything into a clear, actionable document."

### 2. Compile Investigation Results

Gather from previous steps:

**From Problem Framing (Catalyst):**
- Core problem and solution
- Success criteria
- Key assumptions
- Open questions
- Constraints

**From Design Thinking (Visionary):**
- Audience empathy maps
- User needs (technical + business)
- Primary audience priority
- Dual-audience challenges

**From Creative Problem-Solving (Inventor):**
- Challenges tackled
- Alternatives considered
- Decision rationale
- Innovation assessment
- Remaining uncertainties

### 3. Create Investigation Document

"**I'm creating your Solution Investigation document...**"

Generate document with structure:

```markdown
# Solution Investigation: {Solution Name}

**Date:** {date}
**Investigated By:** {user_name}
**Primary Audience:** {technical/business}

---

## Executive Summary

{2-3 paragraph summary of solution and investigation findings}

## Solution Overview

### Core Problem
{problem statement}

### Proposed Solution
{solution description}

### Success Criteria
{list}

### Key Constraints

## Audience Analysis

### Technical Audience Needs
{from empathy map}

### Business Audience Needs
{from empathy map}

### Documentation Priority
{primary audience and rationale}

---

## Solution Architecture

### Key Components
{from problem framing}

### Critical Decisions
{from problem-solving}

### Alternatives Considered
{list with rationale for rejection/selection}

## Assumptions & Dependencies

### Assumptions
{list}

### Dependencies
{list}

### Risks & Uncertainties
{list}

## Next Steps

### Ready for Documentation
- [ ] Proceed to SDA Main Workflow
- [ ] Use investigation insights in Phase 1 (knowledge review)
- [ ] Apply audience priority setting

### Requires Further Investigation
{any remaining gaps}

## Investigation Team Notes

**Catalyst:** {key insights from problem framing}
**Visionary:** {key insights from design thinking}
**Inventor:** {key insights from problem-solving}

_Investigation completed: {timestamp}_
```

### 4. Save Document

Save to: `{output_folder}/solution-investigation/{solution-name}-investigation.md`

"**✅ Investigation document saved!**

Location: `{output_folder}/solution-investigation/{solution-name}-investigation.md`"

### 5. Review with User

"**Let's review the investigation document together.**

{Display key sections}

Does this accurately capture your refined solution understanding?

What would you add or change?"

**Allow user to request revisions.**

### 6. Next Steps Guidance

"**Your solution investigation is complete!** 🎉

**What you now have:**
- Clear problem and solution definition
- Audience empathy maps
- Validated architectural decisions
- Documented assumptions and gaps

**Recommended next steps:**

1. **Option A: Proceed to documentation**
   - Use SDA Main Workflow
   - Reference this investigation document in Phase 1
   - Apply audience priority settings

2. **Option B: Address remaining gaps**
   - Tackle any unresolved uncertainties
   - Run additional investigation if needed

3. **Option C: Share for feedback**
   - Review investigation with stakeholders
   - Validate assumptions before documenting

Which path makes sense for you?"

### 7. Workflow Completion

"**Thank you for using Solution Investigation!**

Your solution is now much stronger and ready for documentation.

To start documenting, activate any SDA agent and select:
**[SDA] Solution Document Architect Workflow**

Good luck! 🚀"
