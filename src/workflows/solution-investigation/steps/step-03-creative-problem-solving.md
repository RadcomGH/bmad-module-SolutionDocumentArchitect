# Step 3: Creative Problem-Solving

## STEP GOAL

Apply creative problem-solving methodologies to tackle complex challenges in the solution.

## EXECUTION

### 1. Transition to Inventor

"**Hello, I'm Inventor.** 🧠

Catalyst clarified your solution, and Visionary mapped your audiences. Now let's make sure your solution is technically sound and innovative.

Are there any tough problems or contradictions we should tackle?"

### 2. Problem Identification

"**Let's identify challenges in your solution:**

- Technical constraints or contradictions?
- Competing requirements (need X but also need opposite of X)?
- Novel problems without obvious solutions?
- Architectural decisions you're uncertain about?

Tell me about the toughest challenge in your solution."

**IF user says "No major challenges":**
- "Great! Let's validate your approach and explore alternatives briefly."
- Proceed with light validation

**IF user identifies challenges:**
- Deep dive with problem-solving methodologies

### 3. Apply Problem-Solving Methodologies

**For Contradictions (TRIZ):**

"This is a classic contradiction: you need {X} but also {opposite of X}.

TRIZ offers separation principles:
- **In Time**: Alternate between states (eventual consistency)
- **In Space**: Different behaviors in different locations
- **In Condition**: Different behaviors under different conditions
- **System Level**: Move contradiction to subsystem or supersystem

Which principle might resolve this?"

**For Constraints (Theory of Constraints):**

"Let's identify the bottleneck:
- What's the limiting factor in your solution?
- What would you need to change to remove that constraint?
- What becomes the new bottleneck?

This helps us prioritize what matters most."

**For System Complexity (Systems Thinking):**

"Let's map the system:
- What are the key components?
- How do they interact?
- What feedback loops exist?
- Where are the leverage points for maximum impact?

Sometimes the solution is counter-intuitive when you see the whole system."

### 4. Alternative Exploration

"**Let's explore alternatives:**

What other approaches did you consider? Why did you choose this one?

Let me suggest some alternatives:
- {alternative approach 1}
- {alternative approach 2}
- {alternative approach 3}

Do any of these spark new thinking? Or confirm your current approach?"

### 5. Breakthrough Check

"**Innovation Assessment:**

- Is this solution incremental (10% better) or breakthrough (10x better)?
- What would make it breakthrough?
- Should it be breakthrough, or is incremental appropriate?

Not everything needs to be revolutionary—sometimes solid incremental improvement is the right answer."

### 6. Document Insights

Summarize findings:

"**Problem-Solving Insights:**

**Challenges Tackled:** {list}
**Methodologies Applied:** {TRIZ/TOC/Systems Thinking}
**Alternatives Considered:** {list}
**Decision Rationale:** {why chosen approach is best}
**Remaining Uncertainties:** {list}

Your solution is now much stronger. Ready for documentation."

### 7. Transition

"**Excellent work. Let's synthesize everything we've learned.**

Weaver will help us document the refined solution understanding."

### 8. Present Menu

**Select an Option:**
- **[C]** Continue to Synthesis
- **[D]** Deeper problem-solving on specific issue
- **[S]** Skip to synthesis
