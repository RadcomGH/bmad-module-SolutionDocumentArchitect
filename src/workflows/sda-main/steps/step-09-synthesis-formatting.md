# Step 9: Synthesis & Formatting (Phase 4)

## STEP GOAL

Unify the dual-perspective document into a polished final product. Apply visual hierarchy, ensure consistent voice, add finishing touches, and prepare for delivery.

---

## EXECUTION

### 1. Phase Introduction

"**Phase 4: Synthesis & Formatting** 🧵

We have a complete, reviewed document with integrated perspectives. Now it's time for the master touch — unifying everything into a polished final product.

**Switching to Weaver** 🧵 — Your synthesis and formatting master.

'Hello! I'm Weaver, and this is where I shine. I've been watching Chronicler and Envoy collaborate, and I've seen the Review Board strengthen the document.

Now I'll:
- Ensure seamless flow between sections
- Apply professional visual hierarchy
- Unify the voice while preserving distinct perspectives
- Add polish and finishing touches
- Create the final publishable document

Let's make this beautiful.'"

### 2. Flow Analysis

"**Analyzing document flow...**

'I'm reading through the entire document to check:'

**Section Transitions:**
{Check each section transition}
- Does section X flow naturally into section Y?
- Are transitions smooth or jarring?
- Do we need bridging sentences?

**Cross-References:**
{Verify internal references}
- Links between sections accurate?
- Forward references make sense?
- Backward references don't create circular logic?

**Narrative Coherence:**
- Does the story arc hold together?
- Are main themes reinforced throughout?
- Do conclusions connect back to opening?

**Voice Consistency:**
- Tone appropriate for {primary_audience}?
- Terminology consistent (no term drift)?
- Level of formality consistent?

{Identify 3-5 flow improvements}

**Flow analysis complete.** ✅"

### 3. Visual Hierarchy

"**Applying visual hierarchy and formatting...**

'Making this document scannable and beautiful:'

**Heading Structure:**
{Analyze and fix heading levels}
- H1: Document title
- H2: Major sections
- H3: Subsections
- H4: Detailed topics
- Ensuring logical hierarchy (no H4 under H2)

**Visual Elements:**

{If Customer Primary}
**Expandable Sections:**
```markdown
<details>
<summary>📜 <b>Technical Detail:</b> {topic}</summary>

{Technical content}

</details>
```

**Callout Boxes:**
```markdown
> 💡 **Key Insight:** {insight}

> ⚠️ **Important:** {warning}

> ✅ **Benefit:** {benefit}
```

{If R&D Primary}
**Value Highlights:**
```markdown

> {Business impact}
```

**Technical Callouts:**
```markdown
> 📜 **TECHNICAL NOTE:** {note}

> ⚡ **PERFORMANCE:** {metrics}
```

**Lists and Tables:**
- Convert dense paragraphs to bullet lists where appropriate
- Create comparison tables for feature matrices
- Use numbered lists for procedures/sequences

**Code Blocks:**
- Proper language syntax highlighting
- Consistent indentation
- Inline comments where helpful

**Visual formatting applied.** ✅"

### 4. Consistency Pass

"**Ensuring consistency throughout...**

**Terminology:**
{Create terminology map and enforce}
- {subject_name}: Always capitalized? Trademarked?
