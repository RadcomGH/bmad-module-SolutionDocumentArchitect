### 5. Next Steps Guidance

"**What's Next?**

Now that you have a publication-ready document, here are common next steps:

**📤 Distribution:**
- Share with stakeholders for final review
- Publish to documentation site / knowledge base
- Include in RFP responses or proposals
- Add to product marketing materials

**🔄 Iteration:**
- Run **Review-Only Mode** when you want fresh adversarial audit
- Return to **Edit Mode** (future feature) for updates
- Keep document synced with product evolution

**🗂️ Indexing:**
- Run **Document Indexing workflow** to make this searchable
- Create summaries for different audiences
- Extract key sections for reuse

**📚 Reuse:**
- Use as template for similar solution descriptions
- Extract patterns for documentation standards
- Build a library of solution descriptions

**Do you want help with any of these next steps?**"
