# Step 4: Outline Proposal (Phase 2)

## STEP GOAL

Generate an integrated table of contents that serves both audiences. Envoy proposes the "Narrative Arc" (value story), Chronicler proposes the "Technical Skeleton" (system structure), then merge both into a unified outline.

---

## EXECUTION

### 1. Phase Introduction

"**Phase 2: Outline Creation** 📋

Before drafting the full document, we need agreement on structure. This prevents wasted effort and ensures both perspectives are properly integrated.

**The Process:**
1. Envoy proposes the narrative arc (the story)
2. Chronicler proposes the technical skeleton (the structure)
3. We merge both into one integrated outline
4. You approve (or refine) the plan

Let's begin..."

### 2. Envoy's Narrative Arc

"**Switching to Envoy** 🕊️ — Your business value translator.

'Hello! Based on the subject definition and audience configuration, here's the narrative arc I propose:

---

## Envoy's Narrative Arc

**Document Purpose:** {derived from subject and primary_audience}

**Storytelling Structure:**

{If Customer Primary}
**1. The Challenge** — What problem exists today?
**2. The Insight** — What makes our approach different?
**3. The Solution** — How does {subject_name} work? (high-level)
**4. The Outcomes** — What results can you expect?
**5. The Path Forward** — How to get started / next steps

{If R&D Primary}
**1. Executive Summary** — Value proposition in 2 paragraphs
**2. Business Context** — Why this matters strategically
**3. Key Benefits** — Quantified value (performance, cost, time)
**4. Use Cases** — Real-world application scenarios
**5. ROI Considerations** — TCO, competitive advantages

---

**Key Value Propositions to Emphasize:**
{List 3-5 value points from subject definition}

**Narrative Tone:** {Visionary | Pragmatic | Educational} based on {subject_state}

This arc ensures readers understand WHY this solution matters before diving into HOW it works.'

**Envoy's proposal captured.**"

### 3. Chronicler's Technical Skeleton

"**Switching to Chronicler** 📜 — Your technical architect.

'Now for the technical skeleton. Here's the structural framework I propose:

---

## Chronicler's Technical Skeleton

**Document Purpose:** Technical specification for {subject_name}

**Architectural Structure:**

{If R&D Primary}
**1. System Overview** — High-level architecture diagram
**2. Core Components** — {List key components from findings}
**3. Component Interactions** — Data flow, APIs, protocols
**4. Implementation Details** — {Language/framework specific}
**5. Configuration & Deployment** — Setup, scaling, operations
**6. Security & Compliance** — Auth, encryption, audit trails
**7. Performance Characteristics** — Benchmarks, limits, trade-offs
**8. Integration Patterns** — How to integrate with {subject}

{If Customer Primary}
**Technical Depth Sections (expandable):**
- Architecture Overview
- Key Components & Their Roles
- Integration Points & APIs
- Security Model
- Performance & Scale

---

**Technical Accuracy Requirements:**
{List critical technical elements from findings report}

**Terminology Standards:**
{Note any specific technical terms that must be used precisely}

This skeleton ensures technical reviewers can validate correctness and feasibility.'

**Chronicler's proposal captured.**"

### 4. Integrated Outline Generation

"**Now let's merge both perspectives into one integrated outline...**

**Thinking through the integration:**
- Which sections flow naturally together?
- Where does technical depth enhance the narrative?
- How do we avoid duplication while serving both audiences?
