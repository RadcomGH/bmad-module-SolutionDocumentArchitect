# SDA Main Workflow - Implementation Complete

**Status:** ✅ Fully Implemented
**Date:** February 3, 2026
**Format:** BMAD Multi-Step Workflow

---

## Overview

The SDA Main workflow has been converted from single-file format to BMAD-compliant multi-step architecture with 11 discrete step files organized across 5 phases.

---

## Workflow Structure

### Control File
- **workflow.md** — Main workflow configuration with metadata, phase overview, agent team, initialization, output location, workflow states

### Step Files (11 total)

#### Phase 0: Subject Definition
- **step-00-welcome.md** — Welcome, workflow orientation, mode selection
- **step-01-subject-definition.md** — Catalyst questioning, solution clarification, optional SI workflow routing

#### Phase 1: Knowledge Review & Audience Configuration
- **step-02-knowledge-review.md** — Workspace scanning, technical findings report, validation
- **step-03-audience-configuration.md** — Primary/secondary audience selection, lead/support drafter assignment

#### Phase 2: Outline Creation
- **step-04-outline-proposal.md** — Envoy narrative arc + Chronicler technical skeleton → integrated outline
- **step-05-outline-approval.md** — User review, refinement loop, approval

#### Phase 3: Drafting & Review
- **step-06-drafting-setup.md** — Drafting mode selection, parameters, section assignment, document initialization
- **step-07-parallel-drafting.md** — Simultaneous drafting by lead/support agents, cross-review, creative tension resolution (20-45 min)
- **step-08-adversarial-review.md** — Client-Advocate + Product-Guard audit, findings presentation, fix application

#### Phase 4: Synthesis & Completion
- **step-09-synthesis-formatting.md** — Flow analysis, visual hierarchy, consistency pass, polish, final synthesis
- **step-10-completion.md** — Final document presentation, feedback collection, artifacts summary, celebration, workflow state save

## Key Features

### Dual-Perspective Architecture
- **Lead Drafter** (Chronicler OR Envoy) writes primary narrative
- **Support Drafter** adds complementary perspective
- **Catalyst** coordinates and resolves creative tensions

### Adversarial Review Layer
- **Client-Advocate** challenges from customer perspective
- **Product-Guard** validates against technical/business reality
- Catches blind spots before publication

### Flexible Modes
- **Automatic** — Draft everything, show result
- **Interactive** — Pause at key decision points
- **Watch** — Stream real-time updates

### Audience-First Design
- **Customer Primary** → Envoy leads, technical depth in expandable sections
- **R&D Primary** → Chronicler leads, business value in callouts

## Output Artifacts

The workflow generates several files:

1. **{subject}_subject.yaml** — Subject definition and insights
2. **{subject}_findings.md** — Technical knowledge review report
3. **{subject}_outline.md** — Approved integrated outline
4. **{subject}_review_findings.md** — Review Board audit results
5. **{subject}_description.md** — Final publication-ready document (MAIN DELIVERABLE)
6. **{subject}_workflow_state.yaml** — Complete workflow state and statistics

All saved to: `{output_folder}/solution-descriptions/`

## Agent Participation

### Innovation Support Team
- 💡 **Catalyst** — Subject definition questioning, drafting coordination, conflict resolution

### Production Team
- 📜 **Chronicler** — Technical integrity, R&D perspective, architectural accuracy
- 🕊️ **Envoy** — Business value translation, customer perspective, clarity

### Review Board
- 👥 **Client-Advocate** — Customer skepticism, clarity challenges
- 🛡️ **Product-Guard** — Technical accuracy validation, reality checks

### Synthesis
- 🧵 **Weaver** — Final synthesis, formatting, polish, workflow orchestration

---

## Integration Points

### Internal Workflow Routing
- **Solution Investigation** — Deep solution exploration (optional from step-01)
- **Review-Only Mode** — Future audits of completed documents

### BMAD Core Utilities
- **Document Indexing** — Make document searchable
- **Document Sharding** — Extract reusable sections

---

## Compliance Status

✅ **BMAD Multi-Step Format** — Each phase is a discrete step file
✅ **Proper Frontmatter** — name, description, nextStepFile on all steps
✅ **Clear Success Metrics** — Each step defines completion criteria
✅ **User Interaction Patterns** — Consistent menu structures
✅ **State Management** — Workflow state tracked in YAML
✅ **Agent Handoffs** — Clear transitions between agent perspectives
✅ **Error Handling** — Refinement loops and alternative paths

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Full Workflow Execution** — Run complete workflow with test subject
2. **Interactive Mode** — Test pause/resume at decision points
3. **Adversarial Review** — Verify Client-Advocate and Product-Guard logic
4. **Refinement Loops** — Test outline refinement and section editing
5. **Both Audience Types** — Test Customer Primary AND R&D Primary paths
6. **Solution Investigation Integration** — Test optional workflow branching

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future iterations:

- **Edit Mode** — Re-enter workflow to update existing documents
- **Template Library** — Save successful outlines as templates
- **Export Formats** — PDF, HTML, Confluence, etc.
- **Collaboration Mode** — Multiple users contributing
- **Version Control** — Track document evolution
- **Analytics** — Track which sections are most read/effective
