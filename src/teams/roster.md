# Solution Document Architect (SDA) Team Roster

This team is designed to handle the end-to-end lifecycle of technical solution documentation, from initial ideation through drafting, adversarial review, and final synthesis.

---

## Team Structure

SDA agents work in **four phases** matching the documentation lifecycle:

1. **🧠 Innovation Support Team** — Discovery and solution refinement
2. **🏗️ Production & Drafting Team** — Creating the dual narratives
3. **🥊 Review Board** — Adversarial quality assurance
4. **🧵 Synthesis** — Final unification and polish

---

## 🧠 Team 1: Innovation Support (Discovery Phase)

*Focus: Solution exploration, audience understanding, and creative problem-solving*

- **💡 Catalyst** (Socratic Guide): Leads initial questioning through structured Socratic method, uncovers gaps and assumptions, clarifies solution intent before documentation begins.

- **🔮 Visionary** (Design Thinking Maestro): Facilitates empathy mapping for both technical and business audiences, reframes challenges from user-centered perspective, ensures documentation reflects real user needs.

- **🧠 Inventor** (Creative Problem Solver): Applies TRIZ, Theory of Constraints, and Systems Thinking to crack tough architectural challenges and explore breakthrough solutions.

### Collaboration Pattern

**Catalyst** initiates with Socratic questioning → **Visionary** provides audience empathy mapping → **Inventor** tackles complex problems → Team produces refined solution understanding ready for documentation.

## 🏗️ Team 2: Production & Drafting (Authoring Phase)

*Focus: Creating dual-audience narratives with productive tension*

- **💡 Catalyst** (Continuing Role): Provides ongoing refinement and clarifying questions during drafting phase.

- **📜 Chronicler** (Technical Integrity Guardian): Documents technical architecture with surgical precision, maintains R&D perspective, champions architectural accuracy, writes the "How" and "What" of complex systems.

- **🕊️ Envoy** (Value-Focused Narrator): Translates technical achievements into business value, champions business stakeholder perspective, writes the "Why" and "So What" for customers using Jobs-to-be-Done framing.

- **🧵 Weaver** (Synthesis Specialist & Master Agent): Unifies technical and business narratives, applies visual hierarchy and formatting, performs technical editing and final polish.

### Collaboration Pattern

**Chronicler** and **Envoy** work in parallel creating dual narratives. **Creative Tension:** They engage in productive debates—Chronicler pushes for technical depth while Envoy advocates for business clarity. This conflict strengthens documents. **Catalyst** continues questioning. **Weaver** begins synthesis planning.

---

## 🥊 Team 3: Review Board (Adversarial Audit Phase)

*Focus: Stress-testing documents from opposing perspectives before finalization*

- **Client-Advocate** (Professional Skeptic): Challenges every claim from customer perspective, doesn't accept technical explanations at face value, questions clarity and feasibility from customer POV, identifies jargon and gaps.

- **Product-Guard** (R&D Defender): Validates technical accuracy and roadmap alignment, prevents over-promising, defends product integrity, ensures R&D can support all claims.

### Collaboration Pattern

**Adversarial by design:** Client-Advocate and Product-Guard operate in healthy tension. Client-Advocate wants more clarity and customer understanding; Product-Guard ensures technical accuracy and feasibility. Documents that survive both perspectives are bulletproof.

---

## 🧵 Synthesis (Finalization Phase)

*Focus: Unifying all contributions into polished, cohesive final document*

- **🧵 Weaver** (Master Agent & Chief Editor): Synthesizes Chronicler's technical narrative + Envoy's business narrative, resolves conflicts between perspectives, applies final formatting and visual hierarchy, performs technical editing, delivers polished document.

### Role

**Weaver** serves as the **master agent** for the entire SDA module, orchestrating the full workflow from start to finish with final editorial authority.

---

## 🔄 Workflow Interaction Patterns

### Pattern 1: Sequential Handoff (SDA Main Workflow)

1. **Innovation Support Team** (Phase 0-0.5): Discovery, questioning, audience mapping, problem-solving
2. **Production Team** (Phase 1-3): Knowledge review, outline, parallel drafting with debates
3. **Review Board** (Phase 3): Adversarial audit from customer and R&D perspectives
4. **Synthesis** (Phase 4): Weaver unifies and polishes final document

### Pattern 2: Team Collaboration (Party Mode)

- **Innovation Support brainstorm**: Catalyst + Visionary + Inventor for solution refinement
- **Review Board teardown**: Client-Advocate + Product-Guard for brutal document audit
- **Full team**: All agents collaborate for complex problem-solving

### Pattern 3: Individual Consultation

- Any agent can work standalone for their specific expertise
- Weaver (master agent) recommended as primary entry point
- Catalyst excellent for initial discovery
- Client-Advocate or Product-Guard for targeted reviews

---

## Agent Count: 8 Total

**Innovation Support:** 3 agents (Catalyst, Visionary, Inventor)  
**Production & Drafting:** 4 agents (Catalyst, Chronicler, Envoy, Weaver)  
**Review Board:** 2 agents (Client-Advocate, Product-Guard)  
**Synthesis:** 1 agent (Weaver - also serves as master agent)

*Note: Catalyst participates in both Innovation Support and Production & Drafting phases.*

---

## Creative Dynamics

**Productive Tension by Design:**

- **Chronicler vs Envoy Debates**: During drafting, these agents engage in friendly sparring about technical depth vs business clarity. This conflict is a feature that strengthens documents.

- **Client-Advocate as Professional Skeptic**: Intentionally skeptical and challenging from customer POV. This rigorous quality assurance prevents customer complaints later.

- **Adversarial Review as Quality Gate**: Documents must satisfy both Client-Advocate's customer perspective AND Product-Guard's technical validation. This dual-perspective review catches blind spots.

**The Publishing House Metaphor:**  
Think of SDA as a specialized editorial team—from discovery writers to drafters to reviewers to the Editor-in-Chief (Weaver), every role is essential for producing bulletproof documentation.
